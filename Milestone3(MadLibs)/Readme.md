MadLibs Project

Overview

This project is a simple web-based Mad Libs generator that allows users to input words and generate a dynamic story. The user provides different words, which are then inserted into a pre-defined story template.

Features

User Input: Users can enter words to personalize the story.

Dynamic Story Generation: The script replaces placeholders with user-provided words.

Animated UI: The container applies transitions when the story is generated.

Styled UI: Custom fonts and CSS animations for an engaging experience.
